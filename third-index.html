<h2>Why We Believe in Herbst Reflexion</h2>
<p>Like many others before us, we believe in living the best life
  possible. One aspect of life which we must all contend with
  is ourself. Our body and mind are integral to our happiness, and
  the mind is what Herbst Reflexion will address.
</p>
<p>Self-improvement is key to actualizing the potential we all
  enter the world  with. To Herbst Reflexion, art is a form of
  self improvement. As one of our contributors, Sara Herbst,
  puts it, &quot Everytime I leave an art museum, I feel like
  a better person.&quot
</p>
<p>Whether it's viewing and interacting with art or
  creating it, or reading poetry or writing your own, Herbst
  Reflexion would like to share art, philosophy, literature,
  and music with its viewers.
</p>

<p>By publishing essays on current events, analyses of literature
  and art, creating and publishing our own works, Herbst Reflexion
  will bring the enrichment of art to viewers, whether they have the
  natural eye for art, or are trying to understand the complicated
  meanings behind the ideas they are fascinated by. Art is for everyone,
  just open your mind!
