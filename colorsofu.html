<h1 class="title"> Colors of You by Owen Herbst</h1>
<p class="stanza">
Aurora borealis,
Flecks of radiation
Hurtling down blazing the atmosphere
Lightning hue
</p>

<p class="stanza">
Describes you.
Gold, silver, and saffire blue
Ripping it across the sky.
Words cannot describe
The colors of you.
</p>

<p class="stanza">
Flecks, and the night's bright,
By dazzling, northern lights sight
and the beauty.
Not of the radiation,
But the colors of you.
</p>

<p class="stanza">
And from the North,
		powerfully true,
Cracked with lightning hue
A meteroric perspective
	On the colors of you.
