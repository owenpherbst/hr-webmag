<h2>What is Herbst Reflexion about</h2>
<p> We are a magazine interested in many things.
We are passionate about art, philosphy, literature,
and many more things. We want to bring these things
to viewers and everyday people in an interactive way.</p>
<p>We will start by publishing essays about our areas of interest.
Then, we hope that over time we can open up forums, chatrooms,
and comment sections to truly interact with viewers.</p>
