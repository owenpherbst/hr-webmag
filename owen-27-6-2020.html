<h2>Friend or Foe: Are Smartphones Tools or Simply the World's Most Powerful Distraction?</h2>
<p>“With the right mindset, I could take myself, loved ones, and my business to the moon with smartphones, social media, and the internet.”</p>
<br>
<p>Proverbs 14:4
“Where no oxen are, the crib is clean: but much increase is by the strength of the ox.”
	</p>
<p>Recently, I’ve been distracted easily by social media and technology and my phone has been the main culprit. I’ve been telling those close to me that I would like to completely cut out all of my social accounts and go cold turkey. Sometimes I’ll even tell people that I’m going to sell my iPhone and purchase a phone exclusively designed for calling and simple texting. Needless to say, I feel very tempted and distracted by my phone and social media. It is mainly because I fail to use these technologies effectively as a tool.</p>

<p>I’ve quit my social media accounts several times already in the last few years and it’s been very helpful in cutting out distractions and improving my focus. As a young man in today’s age, though, I feel like this is a huge sacrifice and that I am missing out on a lot of opportunities to socialize and learn. Many of my peers use these platforms to connect and my family and friends who I do not often see are much easier to connect with and catch up with on these social platforms such as Skype, Instagram, and Snapchat. YouTube and Instagram are both hosts to huge groups of creators and educated professionals who have taken time to produce and monetize valuable information for almost no money up front.
</p>
<p>I would argue that the iPhone is the most significant handheld tool since the first tools ever used. Let’s briefly go back to the dawn of humanity. 
</p>
<p>The first, most powerful handheld tools were rocks. In “Stone Tools,” an article produced by the Smithsonian, rocks used for smashing and other implementations are called hammerstones. They are identified due to the shape and wear on the surface of the tool. Early hominids would take advantage of the leverage found in their arm to swing the weight and hammer. Then, they used the hammerstone to produce stone flakes made of flint and obsidian. Razor sharp, the flakes took advantage of the edge to produce high shear stress on objects and animals to shape wood, hunt and kill, and manipulate the environment. Using the hammerstone to hammer and the stone flakes to slice, early hominids increased their influence on the world and their chances of survival rose. </p>
<p>Stone tools and flakes allowed humanity to realize the potential of tools. While technology evolved over time, each iteration of the hand tools available to humans increased in value and power each time. Spears and arrows increased hunting potential. Hoes and baskets increased agricultural production and started the agricultural revolution. There were tools much more advanced than stone flakes, but now the tool of the cellular smartphone wields information and communication. It has been the biggest jump in technological power since stone flakes started humankind’s course in hand tools. As of 2020, “iPhones have 100,000 times more processing power than [the] Apollo 11 computer.” Your hand has more power than a rocket. </p>
<p>In a word, smartphones are the most powerful tools to ever be wielded in the hand. They are predominantly used by citizens of the civilized world and are mass produced. Anyone can use them, as their user interface is highly accessible and has been refined to be extremely intuitive. Even if someone cannot buy the newest version, almost anyone can afford a cheaper past model or used, but still newer version. According to the Pew Research Center, 71% of americans, even in the lower income bracket  (>$30,000 per year), own smartphones. Smartphones are approaching the level of popularity that vehicles in America. There are vehicles available for use in almost 92% of households. That is comparable to smart phones in the upper income bracket listed on the Pew Article which shows 91% of people earning greater than $100,000 per year. To reiterate, smartphones are revolutionary tools which are unprecedented in their power to the standard citizen.
</p>
<p>With the right mindset, I could take myself, loved ones, and my business to the moon with smartphones, social media, and the internet. Having the most powerful tool in human history is much like the proverbial ox. “Where no oxen are, the crib is clean: but much increase is by the strength of the ox.” Proverbs 14:4. Where no iPhone is being used, there is no risk of distraction: but much gain is by the communicative and informative potential thereof. 
</p>
<p>When I first read the proverb, I realized how truly it applied to the human lot and started thinking about the ownership of high risk, high reward tools and means.There are many things which we must contend with as individuals. Food can be a great source of pleasure or it can be a huge cause for health concerns in obesity. However, I mainly thought about the aforementioned discussion. My iPhone was the ox in my life. My living environment was no longer clean. The thoughts had become disorganized inside my head. However, I can see the utility I can gain from the strength of my phone. </p>
<p>I realized it was not the phone’s fault. The phone is someone’s business. They designed it to retain my attention for as long as I was willing to give the attention to their product. Therefore, the responsibility fell on my part, for I needed to control how much attention I was willing to give to their product. 
</p>
<p>My thinking began to stretch to encompass other areas of my knowledge and experience, and James Allen’s book “As a Man Thinketh,” came to mind. Allen’s work argues that humanity will rise to its highest aspirations and will sink as low as its basest desires. If the basest desire one has is a lofty aspiration, then surely a man or woman can rise. I took this to indicate that if my lowest desire in phone usage is entertainment, then my mind will certainly sink low to entertainment, and it may refuse to rise above that desire. 
</p>
<p>My hope is that you will join me in changing the environment found surrounding our phones, and you are part of that environment. Either by conscious choice or by subconscious association, you contribute. Here are some actions I encourage you to try:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Delete the apps which you never use, use too often (be honest. If you can’t get off the app, you may need to delete it.) and simplify your home screen. 
</li>
	<li>Select a room of the house for each activity you need to do on your phone.
</li>
	<li>Turn your phone to grey scale unless you are using it for entertainment.
</li>
	</ol>
<p>First, simplifying your home screen and removing distractions shows your mind that the phone is a tool. Since there are a reduced amount of choices to be distracted by, it will help you cognitively shortcut to the actions you truly need your phone unlocked to do.
</p>
<p>Second, separate work and leisure. Sit in your TV room to entertain yourself, sit at your desk to do work, and sit in the kitchen if you need to use it for recipes. For your mind’s sake, stop using your phone in your bed. At least sit in another space. All of these divisions I have listed will clearly designate what your mind should be focused on, whether it is work or leisure. Define your own rules!
</p>
<p>Finally, modern phones use hyper-colorful displays to grab your attention. Imagine a primate or early human seeing a fruit or berry as red, green, or blue, as your phone screen. They would kill to eat that berry. Your mind craves more when it sees the flashing colors on the screen. At least try it, turn your phone to grayscale. It should take a few moments. How boring is it in comparison? It’s stunning how unappealing it becomes. Consider using this setting to remove distractions and pursue a more meaningful and effective way to use your phone. 
</p>
<p>The proverb which initially started my mind down this path does not simply apply to using smartphones excessively. It applies to every thought a person has, and to every activity they pursue. Raise your aspirations and change your environment. It’s not as though you can fix everything at once, but please join me in taking a step in the right direction.
