<h2>Why We Believe in Herbst Reflexion</h2>
<p>Like many others before us, we believe in living the best life
possible. One aspect of life which we must all contend with
is ourself. Our body and mind are integral to our happiness, and
the mind is what Herbst Reflexion will address.
	</p>
<p>Self-improvement is key to actualizing the potential we all
enter the world  with. To Herbst Reflexion, art is a form of
self improvement. As one of our contributors, Sara Herbst,
puts it, &quot Everytime I leave an art museum, I feel like
a better person.&quot
	</p>
<p>Whether it's viewing and interacting with art or
creating it, or reading poetry or writing your own, Herbst
Reflexion would like to share art, philosophy, literature,
and music with its viewers.
	</p>

<p>By publishing essays on current events, analyses of literature
and art, creating and publishing our own works, Herbst Reflexion
will bring the enrichment of art to viewers, whether they have the
natural eye for art, or are trying to understand the complicated
meanings behind the ideas they are fascinated by. Art is for everyone,
just open your mind!
