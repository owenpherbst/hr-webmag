<pre {background color:Orchid;}>
Aurora borealis, 
Flecks of radiation
Hurtling down blazing the atmosphere
	Lightning hue
	
Describes you.
Gold, silver, and saffire blue
Ripping it across the sky. 
Words cannot describe
	The colors of you.

Flecks, and the night's bright,
By dazzling, northern lights sight
and the beauty. 
Not of the radiation,
	But the colors of you. 

And from the North,
		powerfully true,                         
Cracked with lightning hue
A meteroric perspective
	On the colors of you.
